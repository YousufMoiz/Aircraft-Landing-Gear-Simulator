# Aircraft-Landing-Gear-Simulator
We simulated the landing gear mechanism of an aircraft with proper disturbance rejection. This was the project for our course "Principles of Feedback Control. The arduino code that was used to control the simulator is in the folder "Motor_Controller". For more details and pictures of the project refer to the report of the project attached.
